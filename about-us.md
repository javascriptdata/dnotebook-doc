# About Us

Danfo Notebook \(Dnotebook\) is an open-source project, born out of the need to perform quick, interactive experimentation and prototyping with [Danfo.js](https://danfo.jsdata.org). Danfo Notebook is a similar to the popular [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org) but is customized for the JavaScript environment. Dnotebook is part of our grand vision at [JSdata](https://github.com/opensource9ja) to bring more Data Science and Machine Learning tools to the JavaScript ecosystem.

Dnotebook is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/opensource9ja/notebookjs).
