# Dnotebook Documentation

Danfo Notebook \(Dnotebook\) is an open-source project, born out of the need to perform quick and interactive experimentation/prototyping with [Danfo.js](https://danfo.jsdata.org/). Dnotebook is similar to the popular [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) but is customized for the JavaScript environment. It is a part of our grand vision at [JSdata](https://github.com/opensource9ja) to bring more Data Science and Machine Learning tools to the JavaScript ecosystem.

## What can it be used for?

Dnotebook allows you to create and share pages that contain live code, text and visualizations in a textbook-like manner.

### **Data Science/Analysis**

Easily perform interactive data exploration and analysis using efficient JavaScript packages like Danfo.js.

### **Machine Learning**

Easily build, train and prototype machine learning models using different tools like Tensorflow.js

### **Learning JavaScript Interactively**

Learn/teach JavaScript in an interactive/visual style. This can hasten learning and understanding.

### **Plain Experimentation/Prototype**

Any experimentation performed in JavaScript can run on Dnotebooks.
